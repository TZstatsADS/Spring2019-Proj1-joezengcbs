Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: A Close Look at the Categories of Happy Moments
+ This project is conducted by Yiyang Zeng

+ Project summary: [a short summary] For this project, I would like to explore different categories of happy moments, what might be the main drivers for these categories and how are categories different from each other. Some of the techniques in this project that I have used include sentiment analysis and topic analysis.The source of the dataset comes from a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Detailed information about the dataset is on https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/.
